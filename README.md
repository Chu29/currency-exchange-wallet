## About This Project

This project is a React-based Currency Exchange Wallet designed to demonstrate effective state management and data manipulation within a React application.

The wallet allows users to manage balances across three currencies: USD, EUR, and XAF. Users can deposit funds into any currency, exchange amounts between currencies using predefined exchange rates, and select a default currency for viewing their total wallet value.

The application dynamically calculates the totalized value of all currency balances and displays it in the user’s selected default currency. All currency conversions are handled in real-time based on fixed exchange rates.

This project focuses on:

- React state management
- Component-driven architecture
- Currency conversion logic
- User-driven data updates
- Clean and readable UI interactions

It serves as a practical example of handling complex state updates and transformations in a ReactJS application.
